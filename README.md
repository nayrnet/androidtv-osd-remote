This is a simple example application for building an OSD Remote for an AndroidTV. When you press
a button it makes a simple web request to a backend automation server and then exits.

This app was made because I lost this functionality when I moved my Home Theatre System system to a
Nexus Player.

#### Current Features

- Hardcoded, kids cant mess with it
- Simple and Wife approved

#### Upcoming Features

- Return to Nexus Player Input with BT Remote

## Downloads

- None, your going to have to modify this to your needs, build it, then sideload it.
